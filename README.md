# Bicycle Commuting Analysis (Mexico City)

Analysis of government data from 2015 to 2020 to determine which hour, day,  month, and location is the safest to travel by bicycle.      



## Insights

All these visualizations were created with PowerBI and edited using ____. The only exception is the map, which was created with Tableau Public. 

These insights are compiled in a PowerPoint presentation (click here for the English  version and here for the one in Spanish).



## Data

The data used for the analysis was taken from three datasets of Mexico City's government [website](https://datos.cdmx.gob.mx/):

| Dataset                         | Location                                                     | Date of download |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------- |
| Bicycle counter                 | https://datos.cdmx.gob.mx/dataset/contador-ciclistas         | 11-Dec-2020      |
| Road accidents                  | https://datos.cdmx.gob.mx/dataset/incidentes-viales-c5       | 11-Dec-2020      |
| Estudio de Conteo ciclista 2018 | https://datos.cdmx.gob.mx/dataset/estudio-de-conteo-ciclista-2018 | 11-Dec-2020      |

 I explored the datasets and transformed them to a version which I could then use to create visualizations (see [Notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/FranciscoGalan/Bicycle_Commuting_MexicoCity/blob/main/main.ipynb)). You can fin the transformed datasets here:
